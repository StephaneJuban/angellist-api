        Cellar is a new online wine marketplace for discovering and buying premium
        wines online.  Buyers love us because every bottle they buy may be randomly
        upgraded to rare and private-stash bottles from prestigious wineries.\n\nBut
        our real benefit is that we provide wineries a sustainable sales channel that
        never uses discounts. This allows them to quickly sell wine without bastardizing
        their pricing structure or harming their brand image.\n\nUnderground Cellar
        is the first vertical utilizing our patent-pending \u201creverse-discount\u201d

        is a business tool (currently featured on SpikeTV''s \"Bar Rescue\" every
        Sunday at 9/8c) that reduces the time it takes owners & managers to do bar
        inventory from a frustrating 6-24 hours to 15 minutes. We do this by digitizing
        the crazy, archaic paper-pen-clipboard process into a few taps and swipes
        on iOS. As a result, you can inventory as often as every day/shift to control
        your bar, catch and eliminate the industry-average 23% shrinkage (inventory
        loss due to over-pouring, theft, wastage, etc), and put that money right back
        in your pocket. \n\nOn average, our 99.2%-accurate system adds $10,000/mo,
        and improves bottom lines by whole percentages.\n\nAfter every inventory,
        Partender instantly emails you your Purchase Orders in MS Excel, which you
        can forward to your reps and be done with inventory AND ordering in 15 mins.\n\nCloud-based
