        computing is creating operational leverage: small server operations teams
        can create increasingly large and complex systems. These systems are becoming
        correspondingly more difficult to manage, leaving teams to careen from crisis
        to crisis. Inspired by our experience at Google, Scalyr provides scalable
        *operations analytics*: analyzing logs, server metrics, and other operational
        data to give ops teams the information they need to monitor, troubleshoot,
        and optimize production systems. Backed by a uniquely flexible and performant
        query engine for operational data, Scalyr gives operations teams the same
        kind of leveraged productivity that AWS and other IaaS / cloud services are
        providing on the deployment side.\n\nCompanies love Scalyr because it lets
        them replace multiple, narrow tools such as log aggregation (Splunk), metric
        monitoring (Librato), and external probing (Pingdom). It quickly becomes indispensable:
        every weekday, over 75% of our users are active.","high_concept":"Scalable

        is a business tool (currently featured on SpikeTV''s \"Bar Rescue\" every
        Sunday at 9/8c) that reduces the time it takes owners & managers to do bar
        inventory from a frustrating 6-24 hours to 15 minutes. We do this by digitizing
        the crazy, archaic paper-pen-clipboard process into a few taps and swipes
        on iOS. As a result, you can inventory as often as every day/shift to control
        your bar, catch and eliminate the industry-average 23% shrinkage (inventory
        loss due to over-pouring, theft, wastage, etc), and put that money right back
        in your pocket. \n\nOn average, our 99.2%-accurate system adds $10,000/mo,
        and improves bottom lines by whole percentages.\n\nAfter every inventory,
        Partender instantly emails you your Purchase Orders in MS Excel, which you
        can forward to your reps and be done with inventory AND ordering in 15 mins.\n\nCloud-based
        data analytics online show you what''s selling the best/worst, what your dead
        stock is, and what you''re low on, so you never run dry and miss a sale.","high_concept":"Bar

        is a software product managers best friend. PMs currently use a hodgepodge

        built with \"Product Success\" in mind. They were built for other functions.
        As a result, PMs only use a fraction of the functionality that each tool provides,

        is the first software platform built from the ground up for product managers.
        Ramen enables PMs to easily ask their users questions, understand the makeup

        my team, there were only static articles and unmoderated forums. After we
        were done, TechRepublic had cutting edge user profiles, an active and lively
        forum community of self-policing evangelists, and its content strategy revolved
        around a lineup of author- and topic-centric blogs that my group helped develop.
        (We also redeveloped the Jive source code that ran our blog and forum systems,
        pioneering many of the features that Jive itself now offers today.) All of
        this tied into an industry-leading email publishing platform that sent over
        3 million messages per day to over 700,000 loyal subscribers, leveraging a
        coordinated content strategy that maximized page views and minimized unsubscribes.
        People asked for our content because it was so well done and well delivered.
        I helped lead that effort.","what_i_do":"","criteria":"","locations":[{"id":1654,"tag_type":"LocationTag","name":"louisville","display_name":"Louisville","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/louisville"}],"roles":[{"id":80489,"tag_type":"RoleTag","name":"marketing","display_name":"Marketing","angellist_url":"https://angel.co/marketing-2"},{"id":80487,"tag_type":"RoleTag","name":"product_manager","display_name":"Product

        was taught from a young age that hard work and determination was the only
        way to achieve goals. I started my first business at 12 years old helping
        farmers in my small rural town (Otisco, IN) get low income, hard working help.
        I was the first member of my family to go to college. The greatest achievement
        and advancement in my life is when I enlisted in the Kentucky Air National
        Guard. I was promoted from Mortgage Banker to Team Manager within one year
        at Surepoint Lending. I led a team of 20+ bankers that funded $50 - $100 Million
        in closed loans per month. I managed the #1 team during my time with the company
        and worked with Surepoint M&A with the acquisition by LendingTree.com. In
        2011 I started Whaddy.com. I successfully bootstrapped the start-up and development
        from $0 to $1M in revenue with 9 employees in 18 months. I have built a very
        strong network of successful advisers and capitalist. My biggest accomplishment
        is my beautiful wife, son, and two daughters.","what_i_do":"I am the owner
