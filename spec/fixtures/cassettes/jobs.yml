        Maps allows users to upload their survey data, then specify the assets of
        interest and mapping specification. Upon upload, Civil Maps indexes all of
        the spatial information as defined in the mapping specification into a query-able
        format. The maps can then be dynamically generated on demand and exported
        to various tools such as AutoDesk Map3D from Civil Maps, which is useful for
        integrating into the customer\u2019s workflow.\n\nThe biggest pain point in
        the industry is the time to annotate 3D scans. Currently, processing huge

        speed of the user and the limited resources of the user\u2019s computer (I/O,
        CPU, Network, Memory). By circumventing these bottlenecks, Civil Maps is introducing
        a paradigm shift in the workflow of annotating 3D survey data. Advancements
        in parallel computing and deep learning allows Civil Maps to reduce 2 years
        of manual annotation work down to 2 days of processing using our cloud infrastructure.","high_concept":"Adding
