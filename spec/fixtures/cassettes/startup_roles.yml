        is a business tool (currently featured on SpikeTV''s \"Bar Rescue\" every
        Sunday at 9/8c) that reduces the time it takes owners & managers to do bar
        inventory from a frustrating 6-24 hours to 15 minutes. We do this by digitizing
        the crazy, archaic paper-pen-clipboard process into a few taps and swipes
        on iOS. As a result, you can inventory as often as every day/shift to control
        your bar, catch and eliminate the industry-average 23% shrinkage (inventory
        loss due to over-pouring, theft, wastage, etc), and put that money right back
        in your pocket. \n\nOn average, our 99.2%-accurate system adds $10,000/mo,
        and improves bottom lines by whole percentages.\n\nAfter every inventory,
        Partender instantly emails you your Purchase Orders in MS Excel, which you
        can forward to your reps and be done with inventory AND ordering in 15 mins.\n\nCloud-based
        data analytics online show you what''s selling the best/worst, what your dead
        stock is, and what you''re low on, so you never run dry and miss a sale.","high_concept":"Bar

        built with \"Product Success\" in mind. They were built for other functions.
        As a result, PMs only use a fraction of the functionality that each tool provides,
        and spread data about their users all over the place in the process. Ramen
        is the first software platform built from the ground up for product managers.
        Ramen enables PMs to easily ask their users questions, understand the makeup
        of their customer base, openly discuss ideas with that community, and communicate
        all that information back to their team. As a result of doing all this in

        love, and ensure the continued success of their business in the process.\n\nDemo

        is based exclusively on the project quality, transforming this relational
        market into a meritocratic one!\n\nWith CoContest today customers can obtain
        dozens of different projects from designers registered on CoContest, at a
        fraction of the price of traditional designers, and in a short time frame.
        In this way a larger segment of customers can now approach to this service,
        receiving a plural and multicultural offer, thus expanding the market and
        giving the opportunity to many designers, now unemployed, to find new customers.
        \n\nThe response of designers to our initiative was crazy, in less than two

        know those cell phone contracts that folks hate to be stuck in? Cell phone

        one 5-month period in 2014, Sprint breached its contract 8 times, which resulted
        in customers either paying more or getting less for their money.\n\nIn the

        have no efficient way to detect breaches.\n\nProblem 2: even if you detect
        a breach, you have no efficient way to jump through the cancellation hoops
        that the contract requires.\n\nSo you''re stuck in a contract you hate that

        is a business tool (currently featured on SpikeTV''s \"Bar Rescue\" every
        Sunday at 9/8c) that reduces the time it takes owners & managers to do bar
        inventory from a frustrating 6-24 hours to 15 minutes. We do this by digitizing
        the crazy, archaic paper-pen-clipboard process into a few taps and swipes
        on iOS. As a result, you can inventory as often as every day/shift to control
        your bar, catch and eliminate the industry-average 23% shrinkage (inventory
        loss due to over-pouring, theft, wastage, etc), and put that money right back
        in your pocket. \n\nOn average, our 99.2%-accurate system adds $10,000/mo,
        and improves bottom lines by whole percentages.\n\nAfter every inventory,
        Partender instantly emails you your Purchase Orders in MS Excel, which you
        can forward to your reps and be done with inventory AND ordering in 15 mins.\n\nCloud-based

        is a software product managers best friend. PMs currently use a hodgepodge

        built with \"Product Success\" in mind. They were built for other functions.
        As a result, PMs only use a fraction of the functionality that each tool provides,
        and spread data about their users all over the place in the process. Ramen
        is the first software platform built from the ground up for product managers.
        Ramen enables PMs to easily ask their users questions, understand the makeup
        of their customer base, openly discuss ideas with that community, and communicate
        all that information back to their team. As a result of doing all this in

        allowing us to pick up other passengers heading the same location you are.
        Unlike other car-sharing solutions, this all happens in real-time and requires
        no advance planning on your part. Simply drop two pins, and a car comes to
        pick you up.\n\nBy sharing the ride, cost is significantly lowered, environmental
        impact is minimized, and you get to ride to your favorite venue/concert/event
