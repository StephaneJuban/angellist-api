        is an interactive virtual assistant which allows you to perform different
        actions with the Internet of Things by simply using your voice.\u00a0\n\nWith
        IoT, the problem is at the end-user level. Almost all connected devices have
        their own apps. To get anything done, people have to jump from app-to-app
        to control disparate devices, creating a disconnected, rather than a seamless
        or even enjoyable experience. As consumers increasingly become glued to their
        touch screens, we need a more natural way of interacting with technology.
        \n\nMoni.ai provides a single platform from where users can navigate the internet
        of things with their voice. We\u2019re making short work of complex tasks
        via simple conversational commands. \n\nWith our Channel on IFTTT, you can
        control your SmartThings, WeMo, Nest, LIFX, Philips Hue, and more! https://ifttt.com/moniai\n\nCompanies

        BLVD is the first open marketplace for integrated advertising.\n\nThe Problem:
        Integrated advertising, like product placements, sponsored videos and branded
        content engage consumers better than interruptive ads. But advertisers have
        no visibility into available inventory that bloggers, YouTubers, podcasters
        and social influencers want to make available to them.\n\nThey need to know:\u00a0What
        can I buy? What does it cost? What do I get?\n\nWithout a marketplace, demand
        goes unfulfilled, while inventory goes unsold. Both advertisers and content
        creators share significant pain due to this bottleneck.\n\n\nOur Solution:\u00a0An
        Open Brand Integration Marketplace\n\nFor the first time, media buyers and
        content creators will have what they need to buy and sell integrated ads at
        scale:\n\nPrice Transparency\nStandardized Products\nBuyer/Seller Protections\n\nThese

        Research measures a consumer''s experience over time to provide actionable
        analytics that optimize value exchange between companies and their customers.\n\nThe
        patented Stellar Research methodology is invaluable to companies for whom
        \u2018proof of performance\u2019 of their product or service is fundamental
        to their business model.\n\nOur science-based marketing platform allows IT-savvy
        companies and their customers to measure product and service effectiveness,
        transparently, in collaboration with one another.\n\nUnlike online surveys
        and customer satisfaction measures, the Stellar System\u2122 measures the
        before-after changes in a customer\u2019s experience. Others merely measure
        a \u2018point in time\u2019 versus change (good or bad) over time.\n\nThe
        Stellar Research platform thus helps businesses ensure that their brand promise
        aligns with their customer''s brand experience.\u00a0\n\nConversely, Stellar
        Research allows consumers'' experiences to inform a business''s brand development,
        refinement and evolution.","high_concept":"Measuring How Experiences Change

        Design Innovations'' goal is to connect people with nature by introducing
        concepts of sustainability in a compelling way. \n\nThe EcoQube is a miniature
        aquatic ecosystem for your home or office. The heart of the EcoQube is the
        Aquaponics Filter, which grows herbs, house plants, or flowers indoors while
        using the same plants to purify and remove physical and soluble chemical waste
        from aquarium water. \n\nThe filter converts fish waste into fertilizer for
        the plants and the plants then clean the water for your fish, serving as a
        natural water purifier so that you never need to replace any filters. Light
        emitting diodes (LEDs) at the top of the unit emulate the spectrum of natural
        sunlight to ensure that your plant grows with ease. Simply feed the fish,
        trim the leaves, and reap the rewards. \n\nThe same filtration system can
        also be implemented on larger systems such as aquaculture (tilapia farming),
        agriculture, localized food production and sewage treatment.","high_concept":"Connecting

        makes paying online faster and safer for consumers and cheaper and simpler

        - all in less than 30 seconds. This makes accepting ACH easy for businesses
        and making ACH payments REALLY easy for consumers.\u00a0\n\nBecause we use
        the consumer''s existing online banking login info, there''s no need to make
        a new account to use Knox. We provide \"good funds\" ACH payments and charge
        only $0.18 + 0.5% per transaction! This allows businesses to release funds
        or goods instantly without having to wait the traditional 3-5 days for ACH
